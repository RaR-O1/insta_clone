# 🎬 Netflix India Landing Page Clone

A front-end clone of the Netflix India landing page, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project focuses on replicating the look, feel, and basic structure of the public-facing homepage.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes relative units (`max(1200px, 100vw)`, percentages, and `vw`) to ensure the layout scales reasonably across different screen sizes (though full mobile optimization may require media queries).
* **Hero Section:** Includes the main background image, a dark overlay (`.box`), primary call-to-action (CTA), and a navigation bar.
* **Feature Sections:** Replicates the standard sections like "Enjoy on your TV," "Download your shows," "Watch everywhere," and "Create profiles for kids," complete with placeholder image/video assets.
* **Custom Fonts:** Uses Google Fonts (**Martel Sans** and **Poppins**) to match the Netflix aesthetic.
* **Visual Assets:** Uses placeholder URLs and local paths for images and videos to recreate the dynamic section visuals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (using **Flexbox**), and visual presentation.
